<p>Flower Power is a newly established &#8220;U Pick&#8221; cut flower garden located at the corner of Metchosin Rd. and Witty Beach Rd. in beautiful, rural Metchosin. In it can be discovered a wide selection of perennial and annual flowers, the finest ornamental grasses and restios, flowering shrubs and vines and much foliage and filler material.</p>
<p>Flower Power specializes in providing all the floral needs of rural/outdoor marriage ceremonies, special occasions and gatherings. We can design and provide extra large bouquets, arrangements and centerpieces, floral garlands and wreaths – whatever you may desire by way of floral/foliar decoration.</p>
<p>*THE GARDEN IS ANTICIPATED TO OPEN FOR PICKING MID-APRIL*</p>
<p>Flowering commences in early spring (Mar/Apr) building to a glorious full bloom in late spring/summer (May/Jun/ Jul), with many late bloomers persisting through autumn (Oct/Nov)</p>
<p>
Flower harvesting is best done in the early morning or evening. The garden will therefore be open 7:30 – 11:00 am and 6:00 – 9:00 pm Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. If you wish to visit outside these hours, please email to advise when you would like to use the garden and we will meet you there.
</p>
<p>Visitors are encouraged to bring their own containers and secateurs, although we will have clippers and buckets of water that flower gatherers may use on site.</p>

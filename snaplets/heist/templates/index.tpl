<img class="left" width="300" src="/img/calendar2.png">
<p>Flowering commences in early spring (Mar/Apr) building to a glorious full bloom in late spring/summer (May/Jun/ Jul), with many late bloomers persisting through autumn (Oct/Nov)</p>
<p>
Flower harvesting is best done in the early morning or evening. The garden will therefore be open 7:30 – 11:00 am and 6:00 – 9:00 pm Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. If you wish to visit outside these hours, please email to advise when you would like to use the garden and we will meet you there.

<p>Flower Power specializes in providing all the floral needs of rural/outdoor marriage ceremonies, special occasions and gatherings.

Flower harvesting is best done in the early morning or evening. The garden will therefore be open 7:30 – 11:00 am and 6:00 – 9:00 pm Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. If you wish to visit outside these hours, please email to advise when you would like to use the garden and we will meet you there.
